
this programs purpose is to test out scripting using a git bash.


step 1: learn how to create a script file. the way i did this is by typing "nano FILENAME.sh" and that will automaticly
	creat a invoiment fo you yo edit and type into to start creating a script.

step 2: was having issues with the cal command hoever i found that it dosent work for somereason. this was confirmed on
	slash where other people where haveing the same issue.
	
step 3: learned about file premissions amd how to change them. using chmod command

step 4: next was varaible you can se varaible set to may thing like number strings and even data that is on your computer
	like the dir name and other files. on this the date function did not work no matter how much i tried to work wit it.
	
step 5: numeric and string comparisons tought me the use of lt, gt. eq, ne, le, and ge to make functions. with this information
	i can create if and loop statements


step 6: condition statemetns not working only works when directory is wrong and give me an error but run the rest of the
	code however when the dir is corect nothing display and bash just let me type with out running what ever i type
	only stops when i press ctrl + c.

	solved issue: issue was that the input was asking for a the exact dir that the file rinning the program is in 
	at first i had put c/Users/$input but what was need was the rest of the dir that the script was int so the final
	was c/Users/$input/gitBashtesting
	
step 7: after leanring how to create funciton and useing different loops i fell into a hole where i change the bachup.sh file
	to a function and now it does not work anymore. i cant tell what i did wrong.

Code Review (Karan Sanghera)

I liked the way Naeem had his files labeled properly and I was able to know which file contained which part of the code.
A good thing about the code backup.sh is that it was done accurately using the provided guideline last time and is easy to understand
and nicely indented and written.

I wouldn't make any change to the code as it is written properly according to me but since it doesn't produce an output (similar to my code), there is
something that should be changed that I myself am not aware of either.
